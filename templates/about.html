    This is a collection of patterns generated with p5.js. See it as a personal sandbox to share patterns I've recently designed. The website is entirely open source, here is the <a href="https://github.com/lorismat/just.random.lines">repository</a>.
    <br><br>
		<span class="fw-bolder">Acknowlegment</span><br> Some patterns I've created are inspired by other artists, <a href="" target=_blank>Daniel Shiffman</a> and <a href="" target=_blank>Anders Hoff</a> among others. I highly recommend checking them out! For every piece, you will see which original piece inspired me in the comment of the code, if any.
